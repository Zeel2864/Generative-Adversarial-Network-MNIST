#GENERATIVE ADERSARIAL NETWORK

### 1.GAN ON MNIST DATASET
GAN concept was given by lan Goodfello, Jean Pouget, Mehdi Miraz and many others in 2014.

GAN has two types of Networks:
1.Generator Network
2.Discriminator Network

Generator learns to generate fake image that look real,
to fool Discrimiantor and Discriminator learns to distinguish between what real and fake.
both Network competes with each other to win over each other.
